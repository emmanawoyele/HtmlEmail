<h2>Birthday Parties</h2>
<p>MASTERPIECE birthday parties are great fun for all ages and as we arrange parties from the very young upwards we adapt the party to suit the age group.</p>

<p>Alongside the very popular pottery painting parties, MasterPiece now also offers parties in mosaics and decopatch, all at �10 head to include party bag and your own party hostess to run the party. Teddy Bear making parties are �17.50 a head and include the teddy bear, t shirt and fabric painting.</p><img src="birthday.jpg">
<ul>
<li> Up to 6 years - For the younger painter parties are booked for 90 minutes to allow for an hour painting and half an hour for food. Some hosts like to bring along a short game such as 'pass the parcel' which is always popular with this age group. If you have very young children and would like to hold your birthday party at MasterPiece we will be happy book the party room for you and your guests and run a short painting session, you can bring your own games for the rest of the party time.</li>
<li> ver 6 years - The parties are booked for two hours to allow a 90 minute painting session.</li>
 <p>Pieces suitable for party painting are items such as plates, cups, tiles and mugs which allow for a picture to be painted onto the pottery. The host can arrange for a choice of two or three pieces to be offered and the children choose their picture from our selection, or painters can draw their own if preferred. The pictures are transferred on using our special tracing paper (or wooden templates are used for young painter), colours chosen and then painted on. The pottery is left with us to be glazed and fired and will be ready for collection from the studio within a week - individually wrapped and named. All paint is washable and non toxic.
